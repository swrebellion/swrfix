# swrfix - SWRebellion Fix

## Overview

This is a minimal repository containing only a README file for the "swrfix" project, described as "SWRebellion Fix". The repository appears to be in its initial state with no implemented functionality or architecture established yet.

## System Architecture

Currently, no system architecture has been implemented. This appears to be a greenfield project that needs to be developed from scratch.

## Key Components

No components have been implemented yet. The following are typical components that may need to be considered for future development:

- Frontend application (technology stack to be determined)
- Backend API services (technology stack to be determined)
- Database layer (potentially using Drizzle ORM)
- Authentication system
- Business logic modules

## Data Flow

No data flow has been established as the application has not been implemented yet.

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies have been identified or configured yet. Common dependencies that may be needed include:

- Package managers (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
- Database systems (potentially PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM)
- Authentication providers
- Third-party APIs or services

## Deployment Strategy

No deployment strategy has been defined yet. Typical considerations for future deployment might include:

- Hosting platform selection
- Environment configuration (development, staging, production)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Database hosting and migration strategies

## Notes for Development

Since this is a new project with minimal setup:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Major architectural decisions need to be made regarding frontend and backend technologies
2. **Database Strategy**: If using Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL may be added as the database solution
3. **Project Structure**: Directory structure and file organization patterns need to be established
4. **Development Environment**: Package management, build tools, and development scripts need to be configured
5. **Core Features**: The specific functionality for "SWRebellion Fix" needs to be defined and implemented

The development approach should start with establishing the basic project structure, selecting appropriate technologies, and defining the core functionality requirements.
